00:00:31.193 --> 00:00:34.935
(Mouse)

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.260
(This drama is purely fictional and is not associated with...)

00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:37.461
(actual people, organizations, locations, or incidents.)

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.590
(Filming was in compliance with COVID-19 guidelines...)

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.691
(and counseling was provided for child actors.)

00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:40.731
(CGI was used in most scenes that include animals.)

00:01:32.385 --> 00:01:34.456
Officer Jung. Got it.

00:01:34.726 --> 00:01:36.325
Press one.

00:01:52.305 --> 00:01:56.946
(Mouse)

00:02:02.427 --> 00:02:05.897
At times, I go on random hunting trips.

00:02:07.666 --> 00:02:10.806
This old lady saw something she shouldn't have...

00:02:11.636 --> 00:02:14.406
and ended up as an unexpected target.

00:02:16.306 --> 00:02:18.306
Until it takes its last breath,

00:02:18.377 --> 00:02:20.377
a prey should fight for dear life.

00:02:21.416 --> 00:02:25.647
However, this certain prey lacks the energy to do so.

00:02:26.686 --> 00:02:29.917
Which is what makes this hunt too easy...

00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:31.256
and boring.

00:02:31.327 --> 00:02:34.357
No... No...

00:02:35.756 --> 00:02:37.566
My puppy.

00:02:51.707 --> 00:02:54.947
(My Bong Yi)

00:03:06.026 --> 00:03:07.797
Moo Chi, do you have something?

00:03:09.197 --> 00:03:10.197
Not yet.

00:03:12.327 --> 00:03:14.897
Here's the friend who'll back up the story...

00:03:14.966 --> 00:03:17.066
of Sung Yo Han being home when Daniel Lee went missing.

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:19.066
- Talk to him. - Got it.

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:20.906
There's something off about him.

00:03:21.536 --> 00:03:22.707
Kim Joon Sung.

00:03:23.906 --> 00:03:24.976
Do you have anything?

00:03:25.077 --> 00:03:26.476
No, nothing.

00:03:26.976 --> 00:03:28.346
Darn it.

00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:30.147
We should've found it before it rained.

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:32.047
What about the finger in the wine?

00:03:32.117 --> 00:03:33.417
It belongs to Na Chi Kook.

00:03:33.487 --> 00:03:35.156
Who does the other finger belong to then?

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:36.786
Yes, Captain.

00:03:39.756 --> 00:03:42.297
Really? Yes, I'm on my way.

00:03:42.697 --> 00:03:45.167
- What is it? - We know who the finger belongs to.

00:03:45.427 --> 00:03:47.297
Thanks for everything. Did you bring your car?

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:48.697
- Yes. - Come with me.

00:04:05.647 --> 00:04:08.487
Up until two years ago, this was a clothing factory...

00:04:08.556 --> 00:04:09.857
run by a religious group.

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:17.297
What are you doing here?

00:04:19.026 --> 00:04:20.066
What happened?

00:04:20.566 --> 00:04:22.397
He's been dead for about 10 days.

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:25.237
No one reported him missing even though he didn't come to work.

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:28.707
What a cruel world, right?

00:04:30.476 --> 00:04:31.647
There's something in his throat.

00:04:38.017 --> 00:04:39.046
What on earth is that?

00:04:39.216 --> 00:04:41.257
I'm not sure. It's heavily decayed.

00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:44.827
Homicide reported.

00:04:55.267 --> 00:04:57.067
(I saw that scumbag who killed the student on the news.)

00:04:57.067 --> 00:04:58.767
(What should I do?)

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:08.346
Got it. Please let me know once Officer Jung is awake.

00:05:09.346 --> 00:05:11.546
Darn, I hope he's all right.

00:05:16.017 --> 00:05:17.017
What is it?

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:18.457
There's a student over there.

00:05:22.526 --> 00:05:24.397
Hey, are you all right? Why are you sitting in the rain?

00:05:24.697 --> 00:05:26.866
Can you give me a ride across the bridge?

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:28.337
Sure, hop in.

00:05:35.606 --> 00:05:37.577
Gosh, you'll catch a cold.

00:05:50.856 --> 00:05:51.986
Thank you.

00:05:54.557 --> 00:05:56.997
I just bought this car last week, you know.

00:05:57.296 --> 00:05:59.567
Leather seats shouldn't get wet.

00:05:59.627 --> 00:06:02.296
Seriously? Are you kidding me?

00:06:02.966 --> 00:06:05.267
Why were you sitting in the rain like that?

00:06:05.507 --> 00:06:07.807
My grandma hasn't been answering her phone.

00:06:08.976 --> 00:06:11.377
So you chose to sit out in the pouring rain?

00:06:11.906 --> 00:06:13.046
You should be wiser than that.

00:06:24.216 --> 00:06:26.457
- I'll walk from here. - Here?

00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:32.466
Just a second. I think I have an umbrella in my trunk.

00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:40.036
Thank you.

00:06:43.437 --> 00:06:44.577
Take this.

00:06:45.307 --> 00:06:46.676
Go home safely.

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:48.077
Don't wander around.

00:06:54.387 --> 00:06:55.656
I guess she lives here.

00:06:55.786 --> 00:06:57.356
Do you know her?

00:06:57.957 --> 00:06:59.226
Let's just go.

00:07:02.257 --> 00:07:04.257
That umbrella was a limited edition. They only made 100 of them.

00:07:04.366 --> 00:07:06.497
I should've asked her to give it back.

00:07:06.627 --> 00:07:08.637
I heard your parents waited 10 years to have you.

00:07:08.866 --> 00:07:10.767
I bet they were thrilled without even knowing...

00:07:10.767 --> 00:07:12.637
how spoiled you'd turn out to be.

00:07:14.377 --> 00:07:17.577
Anyway, I wonder who got killed this time.

00:07:19.947 --> 00:07:21.676
Why isn't she picking up?

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:24.747
She must be really angry.

00:07:34.757 --> 00:07:35.757
Ma'am.

00:07:36.627 --> 00:07:38.526
Did something happen in our neighborhood?

00:07:38.526 --> 00:07:41.166
I don't know. We came out as soon as we heard the siren.

00:07:41.497 --> 00:07:43.767
Judging by the number of police cars,

00:07:44.137 --> 00:07:45.567
I bet it's a murder case.

00:07:45.736 --> 00:07:47.236
You've been watching strange things...

00:07:47.236 --> 00:07:48.707
ever since you quit the civil service exam.

00:07:48.707 --> 00:07:50.106
Your son is going to be the next Alfred Hitchcock.

00:07:50.106 --> 00:07:51.507
Don't be like that.

00:07:52.176 --> 00:07:54.676
I'm going to go and check out the scene.

00:07:54.676 --> 00:07:55.846
You can go without me.

00:07:55.846 --> 00:07:56.846
Bye, Bong Yi.

00:07:56.846 --> 00:08:00.616
My gosh, I can't believe I was happy to be pregnant with him.

00:08:00.616 --> 00:08:03.687
Oh, by the way, did you happen to see my grandma?

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:04.986
No.

00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:08.726
Come to think of it, she's not here.

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:11.296
Oh, she must be at the crime scene.

00:08:11.296 --> 00:08:15.236
You know how she gets worried whenever something happens in town.

00:08:16.437 --> 00:08:18.067
- I should also get going. - Okay.

00:08:18.536 --> 00:08:19.666
Go on.

00:08:31.017 --> 00:08:32.387
That son of a gun.

00:08:33.147 --> 00:08:34.817
He even killed an old lady?

00:09:00.146 --> 00:09:01.246
(Forensics)

00:09:03.817 --> 00:09:05.646
It looks like she burned her hand.

00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:08.486
I think she used her hand to put out the fire.

00:09:12.557 --> 00:09:15.557
Why were you holding onto this for dear life?

00:09:17.866 --> 00:09:20.266
My goodness, my baby.

00:09:20.366 --> 00:09:22.197
Everything will be fine, ma'am.

00:09:24.136 --> 00:09:27.766
Sir, this is all my fault.

00:09:28.577 --> 00:09:32.106
I'd be glad to die instead. Please save my baby.

00:09:49.996 --> 00:09:51.366
What's he doing here?

00:09:51.827 --> 00:09:54.096
Darn this.

00:09:54.167 --> 00:09:56.667
What? What did you just say?

00:09:56.667 --> 00:09:58.366
- Were you talking to me? - Darn it!

00:09:58.736 --> 00:10:00.167
What's the matter?

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:02.777
Do you know her?

00:10:04.846 --> 00:10:08.146
Why do the innocent always have to die like this?

00:10:14.756 --> 00:10:16.187
What's with that crazy jerk?

00:10:19.787 --> 00:10:20.856
What happened?

00:10:25.167 --> 00:10:26.427
(Do not enter)

00:10:27.726 --> 00:10:29.396
- What happened? - What's going on?

00:10:32.136 --> 00:10:33.266
Hey.

00:10:41.376 --> 00:10:42.516
Sir.

00:10:44.587 --> 00:10:45.716
Don't go inside.

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:47.287
Why?

00:10:48.216 --> 00:10:49.356
Well...

00:10:51.587 --> 00:10:53.157
Can we talk?

00:10:53.527 --> 00:10:55.697
- Let me go. - Bong Yi, wait.

00:10:55.756 --> 00:10:58.396
Let me go! Let go!

00:10:59.226 --> 00:11:00.896
(We will be redeveloping the area thanks to everyone's cooperation.)

00:11:09.677 --> 00:11:10.807
Let go.

00:11:12.976 --> 00:11:14.777
Let me go! Let go!

00:11:14.846 --> 00:11:16.547
That poor thing.

00:11:16.547 --> 00:11:19.047
- Wait. Let me... - Let her go.

00:11:19.447 --> 00:11:20.716
Let her check if it's her family.

00:11:20.986 --> 00:11:22.087
Come this way.

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:23.687
- Stop! - Yes, sir.

00:11:29.927 --> 00:11:32.126
You're going to let her see what happened to her grandmother?

00:11:32.126 --> 00:11:34.027
- We need to identify the victim... - Move.

00:11:59.726 --> 00:12:00.856
Grandma.

00:12:02.427 --> 00:12:05.067
What's my grandma doing there?

00:12:05.866 --> 00:12:07.766
- Sir. - Get going now.

00:12:07.766 --> 00:12:09.567
- Why is my grandma there? - Get going.

00:12:09.567 --> 00:12:11.837
- Sir. Sir. - Bong Yi, wait.

00:12:11.837 --> 00:12:13.037
Leave already!

00:12:13.167 --> 00:12:14.366
- Grandma! - Calm down.

00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:16.277
- Grandma. - Just go!

00:12:20.307 --> 00:12:21.917
Let me go!

00:12:21.976 --> 00:12:23.547
- Bong Yi. - Sir, wait!

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:27.646
Grandma!

00:12:30.886 --> 00:12:32.057
Where is he?

00:12:39.427 --> 00:12:40.567
What happened?

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:42.537
He needs to relax.

00:12:42.537 --> 00:12:43.636
- Get out of my way. - Please leave.

00:12:47.966 --> 00:12:49.277
What happened?

00:12:50.577 --> 00:12:51.707
It's because of me.

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.947
If only I had answered her call...

00:12:56.547 --> 00:12:58.817
Pull yourself together. Look at me.

00:12:59.016 --> 00:13:00.447
Look at me, you punk.

00:13:00.687 --> 00:13:03.157
I want you to tell me every single thing you saw...

00:13:03.157 --> 00:13:05.087
so we can catch that jerk. Got it?

00:13:09.697 --> 00:13:10.827
Well...

00:13:12.866 --> 00:13:16.366
While we were at the correctional facility,

00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:19.636
Bong Yi's grandmother called me several times.

00:13:21.067 --> 00:13:23.707
But I had no idea. I finally checked at the precinct.

00:13:23.707 --> 00:13:25.677
(7 missed calls)

00:13:26.707 --> 00:13:28.216
The receiver cannot be reached.

00:13:30.047 --> 00:13:33.516
I saw that scumbag who killed the student on the news.

00:13:33.986 --> 00:13:35.287
What should I do?

00:13:35.287 --> 00:13:36.356
(You've received a voice message from 010-230-0627.)

00:13:36.787 --> 00:13:37.986
You have one voice message.

00:13:37.986 --> 00:13:40.256
Why aren't you answering your phone?

00:13:40.527 --> 00:13:41.996
My goodness, Officer Jung.

00:13:42.096 --> 00:13:45.496
I'm too scared to call the police.

00:13:45.896 --> 00:13:49.337
I just took the bus, so meet me in front of the general store.

00:13:49.437 --> 00:13:51.297
- I have a photo. - Ma'am!

00:13:51.466 --> 00:13:53.966
- But the store was closed. - Ma'am.

00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:56.136
So I called her right away.

00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:00.476
The place was completely empty because it's a redevelopment area.

00:14:00.476 --> 00:14:01.646
Ma'am.

00:14:02.476 --> 00:14:05.417
- And I suddenly heard her ringtone. - Ma'am?

00:14:06.447 --> 00:14:08.047
- I thought it was weird. - Ma'am.

00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:10.886
Are you in here?

00:14:13.626 --> 00:14:16.327
What... Ma'am. Ma'am.

00:14:18.567 --> 00:14:19.966
Did you see his face?

00:14:19.966 --> 00:14:22.966
- Who are you? - No, it was too dark.

00:14:22.966 --> 00:14:24.966
He just popped out of nowhere.

00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:28.707
Anything else? Anything will do. Come on.

00:14:28.707 --> 00:14:30.736
Tell me anything that could be a clue.

00:14:34.577 --> 00:14:36.516
- He was left-handed. - Left-handed?

00:14:37.716 --> 00:14:39.787
I'm... I'm sure of that.

00:14:39.846 --> 00:14:41.616
You told me that culprit is also left-handed.

00:14:43.386 --> 00:14:44.827
The culprit is left-handed.

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:47.327
The angle of the knife is slanted to the right.

00:14:47.427 --> 00:14:49.797
That's only possible when you're left-handed.

00:14:49.797 --> 00:14:51.226
He's left-handed for sure.

00:15:37.106 --> 00:15:38.246
Anything else?

00:15:39.447 --> 00:15:40.606
Is there anything else?

00:15:42.947 --> 00:15:46.047
When we rolled down together, he smelled of something.

00:15:46.417 --> 00:15:47.547
He smelled of something?

00:15:49.587 --> 00:15:50.687
What did you smell?

00:15:50.986 --> 00:15:53.386
Mint. He smelled like mint.

00:16:06.366 --> 00:16:08.707
What brings you here without calling?

00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:12.346
I was at Moojin for a flower exhibition.

00:16:13.006 --> 00:16:15.277
The new housekeeper must be good.

00:16:15.547 --> 00:16:17.346
There isn't a speck of dust anywhere.

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:20.447
Stop sending them. I don't like having strangers in my house.

00:16:21.016 --> 00:16:22.516
You haven't eaten yet, right?

00:16:23.787 --> 00:16:25.957
Make sure to eat on time.

00:16:34.596 --> 00:16:36.766
I put your clothes in the wash.

00:16:37.337 --> 00:16:39.567
You must've had an urgent patient when you were leaving.

00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:43.207
Why did you go into emergency medicine...

00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:47.277
of all specialties that you're always covered in blood?

00:16:52.716 --> 00:16:54.116
That's a nice scent.

00:16:55.417 --> 00:16:57.587
You don't usually use products with scents.

00:17:04.427 --> 00:17:06.996
You must be seeing someone.

00:17:11.667 --> 00:17:13.466
Are you considering marriage?

00:17:14.667 --> 00:17:18.407
Good. I want grandkids as soon as possible.

00:17:18.606 --> 00:17:19.846
I'll raise them.

00:17:19.907 --> 00:17:21.846
Just the thought is frightening.

00:17:23.177 --> 00:17:24.376
What?

00:17:27.487 --> 00:17:29.017
Han Seo Joon's grandchild?

00:17:31.827 --> 00:17:33.027
Yo Han.

00:17:40.126 --> 00:17:42.196
Have you seen that granny today?

00:17:42.267 --> 00:17:45.436
Did she say or do something out of the ordinary?

00:17:45.567 --> 00:17:49.106
She got into an argument with her granddaughter, so she was upset.

00:17:49.706 --> 00:17:51.436
Other than that...

00:17:51.706 --> 00:17:53.176
She didn't say where she was going?

00:17:54.446 --> 00:17:56.146
I think she said she was going home.

00:17:56.217 --> 00:17:59.116
What's this "I think" garbage? Think hard, you punk!

00:17:59.386 --> 00:18:00.817
Don't answer carelessly!

00:18:01.047 --> 00:18:03.186
What are you doing? He's hurt.

00:18:06.027 --> 00:18:07.727
I'm asking some questions to investigate...

00:18:07.727 --> 00:18:08.757
Hello.

00:18:09.156 --> 00:18:11.497
He must be moved into a single for witness protection.

00:18:14.327 --> 00:18:16.267
Take care of yourself. I'll be back.

00:18:19.866 --> 00:18:21.737
A woman in her 70s was found tonight...

00:18:21.807 --> 00:18:24.537
stabbed to death with multiple stab wounds...

00:18:24.606 --> 00:18:27.477
in a vacant house in Gudong Village, a redevelopment district.

00:18:27.906 --> 00:18:29.247
The police believe...

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:32.186
this was committed by the recent serial killer.

00:18:32.517 --> 00:18:35.186
The body of a person presumed to be another victim...

00:18:35.257 --> 00:18:37.717
was found 10 days after he died in an abandoned factory...

00:18:37.787 --> 00:18:40.527
operated by a religious organization.

00:18:40.686 --> 00:18:44.257
Thus, there have been six victims killed by the serial killer.

00:18:44.327 --> 00:18:45.666
Monsters like you need to die.

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:48.267
You monster.

00:18:50.297 --> 00:18:51.837
I shouldn't have given birth to you.

00:18:52.807 --> 00:18:54.936
I never should've given birth to you.

00:19:08.317 --> 00:19:10.386
How will I pay for all these sins?

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:24.396
The officer who was hit by a car while chasing the killer...

00:19:24.467 --> 00:19:26.636
is being treated at a hospital.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.330
I'm sorry, Auntie, Uncle.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.629
You wanted to be a cop which doesn't befit you.

00:19:47.429 --> 00:19:49.169
Honey, I'll stay here tonight.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.199
Okay. Do that.

00:19:51.439 --> 00:19:54.139
It's okay. Dong Koo is going to stay with me tonight.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.479
I'm fine, so go home.

00:19:57.979 --> 00:20:00.479
Okay. I'll come early in the morning.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:43.919
What shall I make for dinner?

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:16.389
Did he get hurt? He isn't the type to wear a character bandage.

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:32.669
(No Visitors: Please cooperate for the patient's fast recovery.)

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.510
- You can't go in. - Out of my way.

00:22:09.639 --> 00:22:11.179
- You can't go in! - Get out of my way!

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:13.280
- Hey. - Let go!

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:15.379
Let go!

00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:20.350
You moron. You call yourself a cop?

00:22:20.419 --> 00:22:22.360
- You need to go... - Get off!

00:22:22.919 --> 00:22:24.620
Why? Why?

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.989
Why didn't you answer Grandma's phone?

00:22:27.229 --> 00:22:29.159
Why didn't you answer your phone?

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.100
It's your fault Grandma died.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.300
It's your fault Grandma... Let go of me.

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.199
Find him.

00:22:36.399 --> 00:22:37.969
Find the scumbag...

00:22:38.139 --> 00:22:40.610
who killed my grandma, you jerk!

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.310
Bring... Bring my grandma back. I'm begging you.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:49.919
Please.

00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:52.120
Bring Grandma back.

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:55.989
Bring my grandma back!

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.760
My... My grandma!

00:23:06.169 --> 00:23:08.129
My... My grandma!

00:23:16.979 --> 00:23:19.310
The Head Hunter nightmare from 25 years ago...

00:23:19.379 --> 00:23:22.020
is being revived now.

00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:25.389
It has been 2 months during which the serial killer killed 6 victims,

00:23:25.689 --> 00:23:28.989
but the police still don't know anything about the killer.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.620
Thus, the people are scared and distrusting of them.

00:23:35.959 --> 00:23:37.459
I've seen this before.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.669
I was on my way to church at dawn, and I saw a big flash.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.199
A flash? A camera flash.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.520
(Photo 2)

00:23:59.389 --> 00:24:01.489
That sick psycho.

00:24:02.189 --> 00:24:04.290
He kills people and takes their pictures?

00:24:06.159 --> 00:24:08.800
Where did this granny get this?

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:10.760
There are no surveillance cameras?

00:24:11.159 --> 00:24:13.469
This is a very old district that's being redeveloped.

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.840
Everyone moved out. Only a few families still live here.

00:24:16.899 --> 00:24:20.209
Then check the dash cams of all the cars that were here.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:21.639
Check everything that caught the granny.

00:24:21.739 --> 00:24:24.939
None of the remaining residents own cars.

00:24:25.479 --> 00:24:28.510
It's a dead neighborhood, so outsiders rarely come.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.189
Her. This granny.

00:24:32.449 --> 00:24:33.590
Where did she get on?

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.520
Hey.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:37.320
Check the surveillance videos from every subway...

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.830
and bus stop by Gudong Station.

00:24:38.929 --> 00:24:40.030
Anything that has the granny on it.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.199
I'm sure there's at least one.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.199
I see.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.469
Hey, Officer Jung!

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.600
Detective.

00:24:52.139 --> 00:24:53.209
What are you doing here?

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:54.709
Looking for Granny's killer.

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:57.909
Did you go to the bus company too?

00:24:57.979 --> 00:25:00.310
In your condition? Go back.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:01.879
I have to find him.

00:25:02.219 --> 00:25:04.850
That camera may have caught something. I'm going to check.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.189
Hey! Officer Jung!

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.669
(Motel)

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:25.540
Where could she have been headed?

00:25:27.739 --> 00:25:30.510
(Appliances and Electronics)

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.149
I get that this is an old building,

00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:33.979
but how can they not have one security camera?

00:25:34.179 --> 00:25:36.949
I'll take a look around, so head back to the hospital.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:38.850
She died because of me.

00:25:39.449 --> 00:25:41.050
I'm going to catch him no matter what.

00:25:47.189 --> 00:25:48.560
Hello, I'm with the police.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.800
Is there a security camera around here?

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:51.199
Then perhaps...

00:25:51.899 --> 00:25:53.070
No, I haven't seen her.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.600
Excuse me, I'm with the police.

00:25:58.439 --> 00:25:59.510
I don't recognize her.

00:26:02.179 --> 00:26:03.280
Hello.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:09.679
I'm with the police.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.350
I don't recall.

00:26:16.459 --> 00:26:18.360
(Housekeeping Land)

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.989
Welcome.

00:26:19.989 --> 00:26:22.199
Hello, I'm with the police.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:23.830
Oh, yes.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:27.399
Did this old lady visit this facility yesterday?

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:31.070
What is this about?

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.810
Have you heard about the homicide that took place last night?

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:34.909
Yes.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:38.540
Wait. Is she the victim?

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:42.050
The security cameras show that she entered this alley.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.820
She didn't come by though.

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:48.489
Please call the police...

00:26:48.989 --> 00:26:52.129
if anyone who comes by recognizes this lady.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.030
Tell me about it.

00:26:57.129 --> 00:26:59.669
It's not like I can report the theft of yogurts.

00:26:59.669 --> 00:27:01.000
Excuse me. I...

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:07.469
Who was that just now?

00:27:07.469 --> 00:27:09.909
Remember the news about a murder in the neighborhood?

00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:12.250
They came by to ask if that old lady came by.

00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:14.050
Really?

00:27:14.879 --> 00:27:16.080
I see.

00:27:17.479 --> 00:27:19.489
Wait. This lady...

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.659
- Is it this lady? - Yes. Why do you ask?

00:27:23.459 --> 00:27:26.330
- She's the one who took the drinks! - What?

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:29.760
- My gosh. I should call the police. - Are you crazy?

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.300
What if it leads them to discover how we hire illegal immigrants?

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.770
Darn it. Just stay put.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:39.139
Let's not make a mess of things.

00:27:39.139 --> 00:27:42.040
- But someone died! - Shut it!

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.780
Would you rather we close shop instead?

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.149
Okay, fine.

00:27:50.879 --> 00:27:53.419
Get in. I'll take you to the hospital.

00:28:01.689 --> 00:28:02.760
What is it?

00:28:03.729 --> 00:28:05.030
Oh, it's nothing.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:06.669
It's messy, isn't it?

00:28:06.929 --> 00:28:08.070
Ignore the mess.

00:28:09.139 --> 00:28:10.239
Sure.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.530
How sweet of you to help out despite the injured arm.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.860
Thank you so much for coming.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.500
Gosh. She did want him as a grandson-in-law, right.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.639
- It's as if he is. - Thank you for coming.

00:28:42.639 --> 00:28:46.010
He took care of the whole funeral...

00:28:46.169 --> 00:28:48.010
even when he got injured himself.

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:51.580
I feel terrible for Bong Yi.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.379
It doesn't seem like she has other family.

00:29:15.699 --> 00:29:17.939
The alley has already been canvassed,

00:29:17.939 --> 00:29:19.810
but we could've missed something.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:22.010
Team One will visit the offices here.

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.479
Team Two will canvass the adjacent areas.

00:29:24.479 --> 00:29:27.479
And Team Three will spread out to even the street across.

00:29:27.479 --> 00:29:28.979
- Move! - Got it.

00:29:39.389 --> 00:29:41.060
Please rewind that footage down below.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:42.360
Sure.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.969
I heard you found a place to bury her.

00:29:54.739 --> 00:29:56.280
I wouldn't have minded a cremation.

00:29:56.679 --> 00:29:58.110
This must've cost you quite a lot.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.209
I...

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.120
scattered my parents' ashes in the sea,

00:30:05.919 --> 00:30:08.550
so I have nowhere to go when I want to mourn.

00:30:11.219 --> 00:30:12.360
You were worried...

00:30:13.729 --> 00:30:15.699
that I'd have nowhere to go...

00:30:16.229 --> 00:30:17.899
whenever I missed my grandma.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.711
Your grandma doesn't drink though.

00:30:42.211 --> 00:30:43.280
You're wrong.

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:47.451
She...

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.220
loved to drink makgeolli.

00:31:08.841 --> 00:31:09.941
What...

00:31:12.841 --> 00:31:14.480
What I last said...

00:31:17.711 --> 00:31:19.250
to her...

00:31:21.921 --> 00:31:24.391
was something...

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.230
I should've never said.

00:31:30.961 --> 00:31:34.730
I'm like this because I listen to you too well.

00:31:34.901 --> 00:31:37.431
What... What was that?

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:39.671
If I didn't listen to you,

00:31:39.671 --> 00:31:41.770
I wouldn't have gone out to buy your makgeolli.

00:31:41.871 --> 00:31:43.240
Then that would never have...

00:31:48.681 --> 00:31:49.810
Grandma...

00:31:52.181 --> 00:31:56.020
Thinking about what I said to her drives me crazy with guilt.

00:32:00.621 --> 00:32:01.961
Grandma...

00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:10.070
Grandma, I was wrong.

00:32:11.631 --> 00:32:13.401
I'm so sorry.

00:32:14.101 --> 00:32:15.540
I'm sorry.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.980
Grandma, I'm so sorry.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.250
I'm...

00:32:29.151 --> 00:32:30.990
I'm sorry.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.661
There's no need to worry.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:12.760
I asked Dong Koo...

00:33:13.461 --> 00:33:14.760
to feed it every day.

00:33:35.221 --> 00:33:36.721
You should get some sleep.

00:33:37.051 --> 00:33:38.350
Let your mind go blank.

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.200
Go on and get some rest.

00:33:54.941 --> 00:33:57.140
On your own though?

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.471
I like boiled pork too, you know!

00:33:58.540 --> 00:33:59.881
What should I make for dinner?

00:33:59.881 --> 00:34:01.611
- I don't want to eat. - You'd better eat.

00:34:01.611 --> 00:34:03.180
Tell me what you want to eat.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:04.850
What? Should I make...

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.980
- Pork... - I don't want to eat.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.461
Wait. Bong Yi, it's spoiled.

00:34:14.821 --> 00:34:16.631
What do you think you're doing?

00:34:16.631 --> 00:34:19.031
Bong Yi, it's gone bad!

00:34:19.031 --> 00:34:20.531
Stop it, Bong Yi.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.700
Stop eating.

00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:23.631
No, don't eat that.

00:34:26.801 --> 00:34:27.841
Let go.

00:34:48.861 --> 00:34:50.060
Goodness.

00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:58.430
My poor puppy.

00:34:58.971 --> 00:35:00.270
What now?

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.370
My poor little puppy.

00:35:05.011 --> 00:35:06.180
Grandma.

00:35:10.611 --> 00:35:11.810
Grandma...

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.729
My grandma.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:24.430
Grandma.

00:36:09.979 --> 00:36:11.249
Grandma.

00:36:12.209 --> 00:36:13.820
Don't worry.

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:18.450
I have someone to protect me.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:26.099
No, not this.

00:36:27.099 --> 00:36:28.930
- Hey. - My gosh.

00:36:28.999 --> 00:36:30.829
Did you find anything?

00:36:31.369 --> 00:36:34.169
- No, not yet. - I even let you carry out a search.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.539
What?

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:39.010
You let him carry out a search even though he got suspended?

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:40.439
Gosh, cut it out.

00:36:40.809 --> 00:36:42.749
Did you check the list of visitors at the correctional facility?

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:47.220
Yes. I checked the list of people who entered the facility that day,

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.490
- but there was no one suspicious. - Are you sure?

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:50.889
Did you check everyone?

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:52.389
Didn't you leave anyone out?

00:36:53.119 --> 00:36:55.519
If you don't trust me, why don't you check yourself?

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:58.760
I just asked if you didn't leave anyone out!

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.329
Gosh, what's with you two?

00:37:02.599 --> 00:37:04.729
You guys used to be best friends.

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:08.539
Hey.

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:12.510
What? CCTV footage? Did you see the granny?

00:37:14.439 --> 00:37:15.479
Send it to me right now.

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:18.180
Do you have something?

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.349
(Here's the CCTV footage you requested.)

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.869
Police. By any chance, did you see this old lady?

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:38.470
- No, I haven't seen her. - No.

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:54.749
Excuse me. I'm with the police.

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:56.289
Have you ever seen this old lady?

00:37:56.349 --> 00:37:57.590
No, I don't know her.

00:38:02.389 --> 00:38:06.160
Hey, Yo Han. A cop came to see me. What should I do?

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:08.160
Just say what I told you to.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:11.499
Are you Mr. Kim Joon Sung?

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.340
I have a few questions for you.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.570
- Do you know Sung Yo Han? - Yes, he's my friend.

00:38:18.439 --> 00:38:21.910
Where were you last Sunday evening until dawn?

00:38:22.709 --> 00:38:24.979
Last Sunday evening?

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.849
Yo Han wasn't feeling well, so I went over to his place.

00:38:30.119 --> 00:38:31.550
He wasn't feeling well?

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.530
Where's my cell phone?

00:38:36.689 --> 00:38:39.090
I must've left it in my car again.

00:38:40.059 --> 00:38:42.430
I'm sorry, but can I borrow your phone?

00:38:42.499 --> 00:38:43.769
Sure.

00:38:44.999 --> 00:38:46.099
Thank you.

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:48.669
Gosh, this is the latest edition.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:52.039
I heard this is really good.

00:38:54.801 --> 00:38:55.801
(Call logs)

00:38:59.771 --> 00:39:00.771
(Sung Yo Han)

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:07.010
Is he gone? Did you tell him what I told you to?

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.660
He isn't picking up.

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:18.961
Maybe it's because it's the latest edition,

00:39:18.961 --> 00:39:20.890
but even the dial tone sounds amazing.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.100
If I have any other questions, I'll give you another call.

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:36.211
Hey, Yo Han.

00:39:38.341 --> 00:39:40.180
No, I never called.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.720
Sir, I think you're right.

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.791
Sung Yo Han is shady. What should we do?

00:39:47.921 --> 00:39:51.361
What do you think? Check Sung Yo Han's dashcam.

00:39:51.461 --> 00:39:52.660
See where he was at that hour.

00:39:53.461 --> 00:39:55.060
That's illegal.

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:58.001
If I cause trouble, my dad's political career will end.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:00.771
He's going to run for presidency next year.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.901
Is that so? Then don't ask me. I don't have a dad like yours.

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:07.711
I need to go now. I'm busy doing an illegal investigation.

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:11.910
This is the police.

00:40:12.041 --> 00:40:14.010
Have you seen this old lady?

00:40:14.711 --> 00:40:15.910
Police.

00:40:16.821 --> 00:40:18.881
Have you ever seen this old lady?

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:20.691
I'm with the police.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:23.521
- Have you seen this old lady? - Her?

00:40:39.071 --> 00:40:40.970
- What is it? - Where are you? I need you here.

00:40:41.041 --> 00:40:43.140
- I'm busy. - Get over here right now!

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:45.111
My gosh.

00:41:09.301 --> 00:41:11.341
I'm so busy investigating that I didn't even get to eat.

00:41:11.401 --> 00:41:12.740
But he's always telling me to come and go.

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:25.021
What? Why me?

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.490
Everyone is interested in what you have to say...

00:41:27.551 --> 00:41:29.120
because the murderer asked you to find him.

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.461
The entire country is waiting for you to say something.

00:41:40.401 --> 00:41:42.671
But I got dismissed.

00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:44.100
I'm waiting for an assignment.

00:41:44.171 --> 00:41:45.541
The captain should be the one reporting the investigation.

00:41:45.541 --> 00:41:46.910
You can't ask a mere detective to do that.

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:48.240
I didn't take you to be such a shameful guy.

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:50.211
What else can I do? It's the commissioner's orders.

00:41:51.041 --> 00:41:52.640
Do you want to get fired for disobeying him?

00:41:54.211 --> 00:41:56.921
Why did you have to say it's a serial murder case on TV...

00:41:56.981 --> 00:42:00.191
and end up becoming the murderer's target?

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.791
We still have enough time until 8pm.

00:42:03.861 --> 00:42:06.060
Wait here and have your speech ready.

00:42:06.231 --> 00:42:07.461
Don't even think of going anywhere.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.361
- I didn't even get to eat. - I'll bring you food.

00:42:15.171 --> 00:42:16.541
Han Kook!

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.711
Ma'am, after you take a break,

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.051
you can go on one more ride before we do an interview.

00:42:39.861 --> 00:42:41.260
- Mom. - Yes?

00:42:41.361 --> 00:42:44.600
Can you buy me that? The Goat Man bread.

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:46.131
I'm hungry.

00:42:47.401 --> 00:42:51.171
Can you wait a bit? Those guys from the broadcasting station...

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.640
are going to buy us a meal.

00:42:58.041 --> 00:43:00.381
Ma'am, can you come here for a second?

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:01.551
Oh, okay.

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.450
Stay here. I'll be right back.

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:43.191
Today at around 3pm, Kim Han Kook,

00:43:43.291 --> 00:43:46.060
the child who made everyone cry on "Hope for Children",

00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:49.060
suddenly went missing at an amusement park during a shoot.

00:44:04.941 --> 00:44:07.211
Moo Chi, wake up.

00:44:08.381 --> 00:44:11.051
Wake up, Moo Chi.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:15.551
You just need to read this out loud.

00:44:16.151 --> 00:44:17.620
The public sentiment is bad these days.

00:44:17.861 --> 00:44:20.990
Don't get angry even if the reporters provoke you.

00:44:21.361 --> 00:44:23.930
Look at your hair. I guess you got some good sleep.

00:44:24.301 --> 00:44:27.901
Don't make any mistakes. This is going to be live.

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:31.071
- Do you understand? - Yes, I get it.

00:44:31.771 --> 00:44:32.841
I'm hungry.

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:34.910
Oh, here you go.

00:44:58.861 --> 00:45:01.171
Thankfully, in regards to the murder case of last victim,

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:04.470
the lady in her 70s who was murdered in Gudong Village,

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.611
we managed to secure a witness statement and CCTV footage.

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:10.481
And we're doing our best to investigate what happened.

00:45:11.381 --> 00:45:15.651
Because of the victims' possessions found in the greenhouse...

00:45:15.651 --> 00:45:17.280
with the body of the college student,

00:45:17.521 --> 00:45:20.791
we've determined these murders to be a serial murder...

00:45:20.791 --> 00:45:22.051
and are investigating accordingly.

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:25.260
Given the seriousness of the cases, we the police are investigating...

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.961
the killer's motive, relationship with the victims,

00:45:27.961 --> 00:45:30.901
possibility of an accomplice or someone aiding and abetting him.

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:34.401
We are investigating from various angles.

00:45:34.401 --> 00:45:37.771
We can't disclose anything more since the case is ongoing.

00:45:37.771 --> 00:45:40.541
We will not have a separate question and answer session...

00:45:40.541 --> 00:45:41.771
after this briefing.

00:45:42.071 --> 00:45:43.740
We will do our best...

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.450
to catch the killer quickly for the safety of the people.

00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:47.510
That will be all.

00:45:47.651 --> 00:45:50.120
There were 6 victims in 2 months.

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.421
What have the police been doing?

00:45:52.421 --> 00:45:53.990
Were you just ignoring it?

00:45:55.421 --> 00:45:58.890
I can't answer any questions about an ongoing investigation.

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:01.760
I heard the killer left you a message at the scene...

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.700
with the college student's body.

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.901
Why did he choose you specifically?

00:46:05.901 --> 00:46:07.470
Ask him yourself.

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:08.801
I want to know too.

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:10.970
You said they were the psychopath's random killings.

00:46:11.041 --> 00:46:12.501
Do you still stand by that statement?

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:16.580
You said there were six victims.

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:17.711
Weren't there seven?

00:46:17.711 --> 00:46:20.881
There's a tip that the same person attempted to kill the prison guard.

00:46:20.881 --> 00:46:23.850
- We're still investigating... - He broke into the prison...

00:46:23.921 --> 00:46:26.691
and attempted to kill a guard. How is that random?

00:46:26.691 --> 00:46:29.220
Are you certain that there is no connection between the victims?

00:46:29.321 --> 00:46:32.060
Perhaps you're barking up the wrong tree.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.430
We've investigated thoroughly.

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:37.700
There was not a single connection between the victims.

00:46:46.341 --> 00:46:48.140
Are the victims...

00:46:48.611 --> 00:46:49.711
What is it?

00:46:49.711 --> 00:46:52.341
What if there was a standard for choosing the victims?

00:47:00.373 --> 00:47:02.313
(Bingo!)

00:47:02.572 --> 00:47:04.382
(Bingo, Detective Ko Moo Chi. Kudos to you. Enjoy my gift.)

00:47:07.682 --> 00:47:09.112
(Restricted Number)

00:47:14.822 --> 00:47:15.893
Who are you?

00:47:16.052 --> 00:47:17.523
You really are good.

00:47:18.592 --> 00:47:22.262
You were wrong once, but that's still pretty good.

00:47:22.932 --> 00:47:24.003
What?

00:47:24.733 --> 00:47:26.463
- Then... - That's right.

00:47:26.463 --> 00:47:28.503
There is a standard by which I choose my victims.

00:47:28.603 --> 00:47:31.273
So why did I choose that kid?

00:47:31.273 --> 00:47:33.302
- What? - Why will that kid die?

00:47:33.373 --> 00:47:34.713
What did that kid do wrong?

00:47:34.713 --> 00:47:37.643
- You... - I liked your briefing.

00:47:38.213 --> 00:47:40.552
What show was it when you yapped about it being random?

00:47:41.282 --> 00:47:43.952
Figure out the reason I killed the kid and announce it there.

00:47:45.123 --> 00:47:46.952
Don't go on air drunk this time.

00:47:47.052 --> 00:47:48.253
Take this seriously.

00:47:48.452 --> 00:47:50.293
A person's life is at stake.

00:47:50.463 --> 00:47:52.023
What? You psycho jerk.

00:47:52.222 --> 00:47:55.592
If you don't get the answer right, I'll kill the kid...

00:47:56.092 --> 00:47:58.262
exactly when the show ends with the world watching.

00:47:59.063 --> 00:48:00.373
- I promise you. - Hello...

00:48:04.342 --> 00:48:05.773
Who's the psycho?

00:48:05.773 --> 00:48:07.643
- What did he say? - Who is it?

00:48:07.713 --> 00:48:09.143
- Who is it? - Did he tell you about the murders?

00:48:09.143 --> 00:48:11.012
- Detective! - Did you talk to the killer?

00:48:11.182 --> 00:48:14.012
That's right. There is a standard by which I choose my victims.

00:48:14.112 --> 00:48:17.083
So why did I choose that kid?

00:48:17.423 --> 00:48:18.923
Why will that kid die?

00:48:18.923 --> 00:48:20.253
What did that kid do wrong?

00:48:21.523 --> 00:48:23.793
Who is this rat planning to kill?

00:48:27.163 --> 00:48:29.362
My gosh. What a mess.

00:48:29.362 --> 00:48:30.932
A serial killer.

00:48:30.932 --> 00:48:32.862
A kidnapper. Gosh.

00:48:32.862 --> 00:48:35.702
He came to Korea to find his father.

00:48:35.702 --> 00:48:39.273
As his story came to light, donations poured in.

00:48:39.873 --> 00:48:42.972
The police did not find any clues at the scene.

00:48:43.143 --> 00:48:44.713
- The police... - No.

00:48:44.782 --> 00:48:47.552
So why did I choose that kid?

00:48:47.882 --> 00:48:49.353
Why will that kid die?

00:48:49.353 --> 00:48:50.753
What did that kid do wrong?

00:48:51.152 --> 00:48:54.092
The kidnapper called the mom in Korea...

00:48:54.092 --> 00:48:55.592
and demanded a ransom for his life.

00:48:56.193 --> 00:49:00.393
This is a standard kidnapping. They're after money.

00:49:04.833 --> 00:49:06.833
But wait. A ransom for his life?

00:49:08.202 --> 00:49:09.902
Don't they usually say ransom for their return?

00:49:10.032 --> 00:49:13.373
That's true. But the kidnapper said it was for his life.

00:49:13.713 --> 00:49:14.913
How much did he demand?

00:49:15.413 --> 00:49:19.543
He didn't say the amount yet.

00:49:21.813 --> 00:49:23.152
Did you record the call?

00:49:25.523 --> 00:49:28.353
Have the money ready by 11pm Friday in exchange for his life.

00:49:29.592 --> 00:49:31.163
If not, Han Kook dies.

00:49:36.163 --> 00:49:37.902
By 11pm Friday.

00:49:40.833 --> 00:49:42.873
You like being on TV, right?

00:49:43.032 --> 00:49:45.373
What show was it when you yapped about it being random?

00:49:46.242 --> 00:49:48.313
Exactly when the show ends...

00:49:48.713 --> 00:49:51.112
- By 11pm Friday... - 11pm Friday.

00:49:51.112 --> 00:49:52.983
It's when "Sherlock Hong Ju" ends.

00:49:53.483 --> 00:49:56.452
Would it help the investigation to do the show as he demands?

00:49:56.512 --> 00:49:59.882
Saving the child is top priority right now, Commissioner.

00:50:00.393 --> 00:50:03.023
I don't know. Do you think he's still alive?

00:50:03.322 --> 00:50:04.693
He's definitely alive.

00:50:04.992 --> 00:50:06.932
It's much more useful...

00:50:06.932 --> 00:50:08.862
for him to be alive so that he can show off.

00:50:08.932 --> 00:50:10.733
"Bind. Torture. Kill."

00:50:10.733 --> 00:50:12.963
He named himself the "BTK Killer" because he binded,

00:50:12.963 --> 00:50:15.173
tortured, and then killed his victims.

00:50:15.173 --> 00:50:18.173
He began in 1974 when he murdered an entire family of four,

00:50:18.173 --> 00:50:20.443
and murdered at least 10 people over 30 years.

00:50:20.443 --> 00:50:23.143
He also sent letters and victims' belongings to the media...

00:50:23.143 --> 00:50:25.213
as if to taunt the police.

00:50:25.382 --> 00:50:29.213
A common trait of psychopath serial killers is...

00:50:29.213 --> 00:50:31.523
they want to brag about their cruel crimes.

00:50:31.523 --> 00:50:33.693
They want to announce who they are.

00:50:33.693 --> 00:50:34.992
They are exhibitionists.

00:50:35.853 --> 00:50:38.793
We must do the show in order to catch him.

00:50:39.262 --> 00:50:42.063
BTK, a civil servant who hid his identity flawlessly,

00:50:42.063 --> 00:50:44.463
was captured after 30 years because of the letter he sent...

00:50:44.463 --> 00:50:46.932
to the media and police.

00:50:46.932 --> 00:50:49.333
He left his DNA on that letter.

00:50:49.472 --> 00:50:51.242
He left his DNA on the letter?

00:50:51.242 --> 00:50:55.112
It wasn't intentional. He was drunk on exhibitionism and made a mistake.

00:50:55.112 --> 00:50:58.813
That's right. Dr. Daniel Lee told me while preparing for the last show...

00:50:58.983 --> 00:51:02.083
that psychopaths like this get so arrogant...

00:51:02.083 --> 00:51:04.152
that they make ridiculous mistakes.

00:51:04.253 --> 00:51:07.822
Yes. That's how the Head Hunter Han Seo Joon was caught.

00:51:08.123 --> 00:51:09.923
He murdered over 20 people in a year...

00:51:09.923 --> 00:51:12.362
and didn't leave a single clue, let alone a witness.

00:51:12.362 --> 00:51:14.463
But he mistook a family of four in an RV...

00:51:23.373 --> 00:51:24.842
as a family of three.

00:51:25.702 --> 00:51:29.612
He didn't kill the youngest and ended up getting caught.

00:51:30.213 --> 00:51:33.443
He was also overcome with arrogance and made a crucial mistake.

00:51:34.713 --> 00:51:36.853
(Sent a letter to a TV station saying he wants attention.)

00:51:36.853 --> 00:51:37.923
Look.

00:51:38.023 --> 00:51:40.722
(Bingo, Detective Ko Moo Chi. Kudos to you. Enjoy my gift.)

00:51:40.722 --> 00:51:43.152
His exhibitionism is at its max.

00:51:43.293 --> 00:51:45.862
If I take the stage and lure him as he wants,

00:51:45.923 --> 00:51:47.193
he may be caught easily.

00:51:47.262 --> 00:51:49.663
Then he'll make a critical mistake.

00:51:50.132 --> 00:51:51.932
He dreams of a theatrical crime,

00:51:52.003 --> 00:51:54.273
but we will conduct a theatrical investigation.

00:51:54.333 --> 00:51:56.273
And if we take the stage,

00:51:56.273 --> 00:51:57.972
we may obtain new information about him...

00:51:57.972 --> 00:52:00.342
that we could not find before.

00:52:00.342 --> 00:52:02.943
That is why this show will be of big help to the investigation.

00:52:02.943 --> 00:52:06.182
Anyway. Can you find the answer?

00:52:06.182 --> 00:52:08.382
You have only four days left.

00:52:09.313 --> 00:52:11.083
I promise I'll find it.

00:52:11.253 --> 00:52:13.382
If we say we'll do the show because the killer demanded it,

00:52:13.382 --> 00:52:15.092
people will criticize us.

00:52:15.092 --> 00:52:16.152
That's why...

00:52:16.923 --> 00:52:19.092
we must prepare for it under the strictest of confidence.

00:52:21.193 --> 00:52:23.132
Please trust me on this, Commissioner.

00:52:24.532 --> 00:52:25.663
Chief.

00:52:34.873 --> 00:52:36.612
Fine. Let's do it.

00:52:48.452 --> 00:52:51.423
The police commissioner and the current events chief.

00:52:53.762 --> 00:52:54.862
And Detective Kang.

00:53:06.802 --> 00:53:08.273
- What is it? - What?

00:53:08.273 --> 00:53:10.143
Don't play dumb.

00:53:10.682 --> 00:53:13.112
Why did OBN's current events chief come all the way here?

00:53:13.112 --> 00:53:16.182
With the police commissioner too. They both looked quite serious.

00:53:16.813 --> 00:53:18.782
Do you think I'm your inside man?

00:53:18.853 --> 00:53:20.623
Find out for yourself!

00:53:22.423 --> 00:53:25.123
Darn it. Detective Kang!

00:53:38.103 --> 00:53:39.242
(Yoo Won Chul: I finished editing. Take a look please.)

00:53:44.083 --> 00:53:45.112
("Sherlock Hong Ju")

00:54:15.742 --> 00:54:17.742
There were seven victims.

00:54:17.742 --> 00:54:19.882
Excluding Song Soo Ho, who was killed out of rage.

00:54:19.882 --> 00:54:21.913
The Gudong granny took a picture from him,

00:54:21.983 --> 00:54:24.452
so he probably killed her to protect his identity. Out.

00:54:24.623 --> 00:54:27.893
I had said the remaining five were killed randomly,

00:54:28.222 --> 00:54:29.452
but it was not random.

00:54:29.452 --> 00:54:31.623
We must figure out the reason he chose them...

00:54:32.092 --> 00:54:34.532
before the show begins.

00:54:35.193 --> 00:54:38.233
Let's talk to their friends and families again.

00:54:38.233 --> 00:54:40.873
We'll find a similarity if we keep looking.

00:54:41.932 --> 00:54:44.003
How long have you known Na Chi Kook?

00:54:44.003 --> 00:54:45.443
We've been friends since 10th grade.

00:54:45.673 --> 00:54:46.943
Then you must know him well.

00:54:47.072 --> 00:54:48.512
Tell me about him.

00:54:48.512 --> 00:54:50.882
Anything is fine. Anything you can think of.

00:54:52.342 --> 00:54:53.443
Why do you ask?

00:54:53.443 --> 00:54:55.512
Is this related to catching the killer?

00:54:57.152 --> 00:54:58.623
- Well... - Ba Reum.

00:55:00.023 --> 00:55:02.152
Detective, you have to watch the news.

00:55:03.423 --> 00:55:05.293
We will play the phone call...

00:55:05.362 --> 00:55:08.762
between Detective Ko Moo Chi and the killer again.

00:55:08.762 --> 00:55:10.603
We'll play it in full without editing.

00:55:10.603 --> 00:55:12.333
Why will that kid die?

00:55:12.333 --> 00:55:13.563
What did that kid do wrong?

00:55:13.902 --> 00:55:16.032
You like being on TV, right?

00:55:16.402 --> 00:55:18.842
What show was it when you yapped about it being random?

00:55:19.472 --> 00:55:22.043
Figure out the reason I killed the kid and announce it there.

00:55:23.413 --> 00:55:26.213
Don't go on air drunk this time. Take this seriously.

00:55:26.413 --> 00:55:28.413
Darn it.

00:55:29.182 --> 00:55:30.983
The shocking revelation continues.

00:55:31.222 --> 00:55:33.322
The special task force team...

00:55:33.382 --> 00:55:36.693
is secretly putting together a special episode for him.

00:55:37.393 --> 00:55:40.293
Is it truly the best course of action...

00:55:40.393 --> 00:55:43.092
for the police to give in to the killer's request?

00:55:43.193 --> 00:55:44.563
What do you make of this?

00:55:44.663 --> 00:55:47.273
- Is the phone call authentic? - Will the special episode happen?

00:55:47.333 --> 00:55:49.432
Is it true that you're giving in to the killer's request?

- Detective! - Tell us the truth.

00:55:56.972 --> 00:55:58.842
- What's the truth? - Is this true?

Did you see his face?

00:56:14.893 --> 00:56:17.632
Tell me! Did you see his face?

00:56:18.003 --> 00:56:19.132
No, I don't.

Why do you think I'm still at this good-for-nothing job?

00:56:38.182 --> 00:56:39.423
Han Seo Joon.

00:56:40.753 --> 00:56:42.822
I'm waiting for the day to kill him with my own hands.

00:56:44.193 --> 00:56:45.693
The one who killed my parents.

00:56:46.193 --> 00:56:47.793
The one who killed your children.

00:56:48.663 --> 00:56:51.503
In order to get behind the same walls,

00:56:51.563 --> 00:56:54.103
I must kill a psychopath who's at least as sick as him.

00:56:54.202 --> 00:56:57.773
Everyone else can be against it, but not you.

00:56:59.702 --> 00:57:00.773
Han Seo Joon?

00:57:02.443 --> 00:57:04.443
Do you know why he killed my children?

00:57:06.342 --> 00:57:08.782
Because I didn't take him seriously enough.

00:57:08.983 --> 00:57:10.882
I also went on TV...

00:57:11.483 --> 00:57:13.182
and got cheeky with him.

00:57:14.322 --> 00:57:15.753
Don't make the same mistake.

00:57:16.123 --> 00:57:19.793
From what I can tell, you're not dealing with a human being.

00:57:20.592 --> 00:57:21.793
He's a monster.

00:57:22.663 --> 00:57:25.833
He's as equally sick as Han Seo Joon if not worse.

00:57:26.932 --> 00:57:29.373
Is that so? I'm glad then.

00:57:30.432 --> 00:57:33.043
It wouldn't be as fun if he weren't.

00:57:33.103 --> 00:57:34.572
Don't you get what I'm saying?

00:57:35.143 --> 00:57:37.983
You may lose what you cherish the most!

00:57:41.983 --> 00:57:43.753
What I cherish the most?

00:57:45.282 --> 00:57:47.293
I lost that already when I was eight.

00:57:47.693 --> 00:57:49.092
You witnessed that.

00:57:50.963 --> 00:57:52.563
I have nothing more to lose.

00:58:02.932 --> 00:58:05.802
The killer set the bait and the police bit it.

00:58:05.873 --> 00:58:08.072
A kidnapper can ask for a ransom,

00:58:08.143 --> 00:58:09.913
but it'll never be considered.

00:58:10.012 --> 00:58:11.882
The killer kidnapped a boy...

00:58:11.943 --> 00:58:13.512
and then told the police to figure out why he kills...

00:58:13.512 --> 00:58:15.052
and reveal the reason on camera.

00:58:15.112 --> 00:58:16.552
We should not condone...

00:58:16.552 --> 00:58:17.983
the police's decision to give into him.

00:58:18.052 --> 00:58:20.282
But there's no other option.

00:58:20.452 --> 00:58:21.952
The killer wants the police to reveal it on air.

00:58:22.023 --> 00:58:23.592
Who can guarantee that they'll find the answer?

00:58:23.722 --> 00:58:27.362
Naming the wrong reason on air might endanger the child more.

00:58:27.432 --> 00:58:29.092
What can matter more than a person's life?

00:58:29.163 --> 00:58:31.103
The police must figure out the right answer...

00:58:31.163 --> 00:58:33.463
so that they can save the boy's life.

00:58:33.603 --> 00:58:35.432
So the police should take a psychopath's word...

00:58:35.503 --> 00:58:38.472
and solve the quiz on camera like some game show?

00:58:38.673 --> 00:58:41.313
Is this the best our country can do...

00:58:41.413 --> 00:58:43.873
to save the boy's life?

00:58:44.242 --> 00:58:45.913
The show must not be aired.

00:58:45.983 --> 00:58:47.753
- Don't air the show! - Don't air the show!

The Commissioner General is putting a stop to the operation.

- But... - I'm sure you're aware of this,

00:59:05.163 --> 00:59:06.503
but the public is outraged.

00:59:06.563 --> 00:59:09.333
If we go through with the show and the boy dies,

00:59:10.842 --> 00:59:12.173
we'll be done for.

01:06:01.476 --> 01:06:04.346
The homeless guy was found with an axe.

01:06:04.346 --> 01:06:07.175
Jo Mi Jung's body was found at a vineyard.

01:06:07.846 --> 01:06:09.346
Officer Jung, did you make this?

01:06:12.516 --> 01:06:13.585
Yes.

01:06:14.126 --> 01:06:15.755
- It's so good. - It's delicious.

01:06:15.755 --> 01:06:16.885
Thank you.

01:06:16.885 --> 01:06:17.996
Listen. You don't seem...

01:06:18.695 --> 01:06:21.496
so fit for the job. Why don't you quit and be a chef?

01:06:23.766 --> 01:06:26.465
I'll think about it.

01:06:26.635 --> 01:06:27.766
You're all done, right?

01:06:28.835 --> 01:06:30.436
We're not getting anywhere here.

01:06:30.706 --> 01:06:32.376
Let's meet the victims' acquaintances.

01:06:35.545 --> 01:06:37.946
- Will you be okay? - Of course.

01:06:38.346 --> 01:06:39.715
I really think you should stay home.

01:06:41.316 --> 01:06:42.415
I'm fine.

01:06:43.186 --> 01:06:44.785
I'm Detective Ko Moo Chi.

01:06:44.885 --> 01:06:47.116
Byun Soon Young. She was in her early 30s.

01:06:47.486 --> 01:06:49.156
She worked as a cook at a bar.

01:06:52.056 --> 01:06:53.596
Park Jung Ho. He was in his mid 20s.

01:06:53.825 --> 01:06:55.625
A temporary factory employee.

01:06:57.125 --> 01:06:58.495
I don't know anything.

01:06:59.236 --> 01:07:00.806
Do you know him by any chance?

01:07:00.806 --> 01:07:03.106
Mr. Kim. Estimated to have been in his 50s.

01:07:03.835 --> 01:07:06.005
He was homeless, so we don't know his exact identity.

01:07:09.646 --> 01:07:12.116
Jo Mi Jung. A college student in her early 20s.

01:07:12.516 --> 01:07:14.116
Worked as a eating-show YouTuber.

01:07:16.415 --> 01:07:18.785
Na Chi Kook. In his mid 20s.

01:07:19.316 --> 01:07:20.955
A guard at Moojin Prison.

01:07:21.455 --> 01:07:23.885
The only survivor and currently unconscious.

01:08:07.766 --> 01:08:09.005
You know what?

01:08:09.766 --> 01:08:12.705
The connection between these people never mattered.

01:08:13.976 --> 01:08:18.016
I need to figure out the standard that made him pick these victims.

01:08:19.175 --> 01:08:20.986
I need to think in his shoes.

01:08:22.285 --> 01:08:23.486
In his shoes.

01:08:31.795 --> 01:08:33.995
His standard for picking his victims.

01:08:42.165 --> 01:08:43.436
("Sherlock Hong Ju")

01:08:43.436 --> 01:08:45.736
We have five seconds before the show.

01:08:46.335 --> 01:08:49.075
3, 2, 1.

01:08:49.476 --> 01:08:50.575
Cue.

01:08:52.745 --> 01:08:56.745
("Sherlock Hong Ju")

01:08:56.745 --> 01:08:58.785
(Please organize your left shirt collar.)

01:09:00.642 --> 01:09:02.743
I'm Choi Hong Ju, the director of "Sherlock Hong Ju".

01:09:03.012 --> 01:09:05.512
We were supposed to do a show on illegal diet pills...

01:09:05.613 --> 01:09:08.323
like we announced on last week's show.

01:09:08.583 --> 01:09:11.453
But today, we'll be doing an urgent live show.

01:09:11.923 --> 01:09:14.892
I'm sure you all know about the phone call that was made...

01:09:15.293 --> 01:09:16.722
by the serial killer.

01:09:17.293 --> 01:09:21.302
The killer requested a live show using the boy's life as collateral.

01:09:21.863 --> 01:09:23.703
Many people were against it,

01:09:23.802 --> 01:09:26.573
and we were also on the verge of canceling the show.

01:09:27.373 --> 01:09:30.043
But Han Kook's mother desperately asked us to do the show,

01:09:30.873 --> 01:09:33.743
and we couldn't reject her desperate request.

01:09:37.012 --> 01:09:40.753
So we decided to participate in the killer's show.

01:09:41.323 --> 01:09:44.793
Here's Detective Ko, the man that was chosen for this challenge.

01:10:17.423 --> 01:10:19.352
It looks like he's been dead for about 3 to 4 days.

01:10:38.073 --> 01:10:39.642
The 28th?

01:10:41.783 --> 01:10:44.583
8:10pm on the 28th?

01:10:45.812 --> 01:10:47.783
That's when Detective Ko announced the investigation report.

01:10:49.423 --> 01:10:51.293
Does that mean he killed Kim Joon Sung...

01:10:58.132 --> 01:11:00.232
and called Detective Ko here?

01:11:00.892 --> 01:11:03.262
Let me ask you straightforwardly, Detective Ko.

01:11:03.762 --> 01:11:05.232
Did you find the answer?

01:11:06.173 --> 01:11:08.802
Can we save Han Kook?

01:11:11.213 --> 01:11:12.472
Let me ask you again.

01:11:13.512 --> 01:11:16.342
Did you find the answer?

01:11:18.552 --> 01:11:19.713
Yes, I did.

01:11:27.352 --> 01:11:28.963
Then tell us why...

01:11:29.562 --> 01:11:32.232
the culprit chose to kill the victims.

01:11:34.663 --> 01:11:35.963
Before I tell the answer,

01:11:36.762 --> 01:11:38.003
I need to check something first.

01:11:42.003 --> 01:11:43.043
You're watching this, right?

01:11:45.543 --> 01:11:48.812
You asked me to figure out why you chose these victims.

01:11:51.012 --> 01:11:52.413
If you want to hear the answer,

01:11:53.182 --> 01:11:55.283
I need to check if you're the guy who called...

01:11:55.283 --> 01:11:56.953
and asked me to come out on the show.

01:11:57.323 --> 01:11:59.722
Prove to me that Han Kook is still alive.

01:12:02.163 --> 01:12:03.692
That's the only way it'll be fair.

01:12:06.132 --> 01:12:07.192
You know my number, right?

01:12:08.232 --> 01:12:12.573
Then I'll tell you exactly why you chose those people as victims.

01:13:14.973 --> 01:13:17.509
(Mouse)

01:13:17.833 --> 01:13:20.833
The only reason I'm doing this show is because I want to save Han Kook.

01:13:20.833 --> 01:13:23.873
This show is the only way we can save him.

01:13:24.043 --> 01:13:27.012
Apparently, we just received something...

01:13:27.012 --> 01:13:28.442
from the culprit.

01:13:28.713 --> 01:13:31.352
If you are underage or feeble-minded,

01:13:31.653 --> 01:13:33.312
I advise you to stop watching.

01:13:33.382 --> 01:13:34.852
Na Chi Kook.

01:13:35.283 --> 01:13:36.823
It's not Na Chi Kook.

01:13:37.423 --> 01:13:39.623
I figured out the common feature of the victims.

01:13:40.153 --> 01:13:41.793
Just show yourself, you punk.

01:13:41.793 --> 01:13:42.823
(Officer Jung Ba Reum)

01:13:43.993 --> 01:13:46.092
You're no deity. You're not even human.

01:13:46.533 --> 01:13:48.732
You're a monster who can never be saved.

01:13:48.732 --> 01:13:50.932
We received a tipoff saying someone saw Han Kook.

01:13:51.272 --> 01:13:52.802
Let me go. Let go of me.

01:13:52.802 --> 01:13:54.972
Turn it off right now, you crazy jerk!

01:13:54.972 --> 01:13:57.173
It's sad that you don't believe me.

01:13:57.573 --> 01:13:59.842
Well? Do you believe me now?

01:14:04.953 --> 01:14:06.552
Do you think I won't be able to do it?

01:14:06.852 --> 01:14:10.823
I want to fly high at least once before I die.

01:14:10.823 --> 01:14:13.623
I don't get why you suddenly want to learn ballet now.

01:14:14.192 --> 01:14:16.323
Just trust yourself and do it.

01:14:16.623 --> 01:14:18.333
You can do it, Grandpa.

01:14:18.333 --> 01:14:19.363
